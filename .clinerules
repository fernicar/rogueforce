# Command Restrictions

## Prohibited Commands

You MUST NOT use the following commands:
- `python -c` (inline Python execution)
- `sed` (stream editor)
- `grep`
- `wc`

## Alternative Approach

When you need to perform operations that would typically use these commands, you MUST instead use Cline's built-in tools:

- **For file modifications**: Use `write_to_file` or `replace_in_file` tools
- **For text processing**: Use `read_file` to read content, process it programmatically, then use `write_to_file` to save changes
- **For pattern matching**: Use `search_files` with regex patterns

## Rationale

Cline's native tools provide better visibility, error handling, and integration with the development workflow compared to shell commands.

## Response to Prohibited Commands

If a task would typically require `python -c` or `sed`, etc, respond with:
"I'll use Cline's built-in file tools instead of [command name] for better visibility and control."
